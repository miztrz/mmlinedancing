  Michelle first started line dancing in 1994.  In 2002, Michelle entered her first WA Stomp competition.  It was then in January 2006 that Michelle made her way over to Tamworth, NSW competing in what was at the time, the biggest competition in the country the Australian Line Dance Championships.

  More recently during the COVID-19 pandemic, Michelle has been attending online technique workshops held by the World Dance Masters, learning the tricks of the trade in the various line dance styling of East Coast Swing and Polka.
