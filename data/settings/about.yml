blurb: I first started line dancing in 1994 with a club called Texan Rebel Bootscooters
  in Wandi, WA.  This also turned out to be the same instructor who started line dance
  lessons at my primary school. Since starting out I have danced with numerous clubs,
  some who are no longer around today.  Today, I am attending classes with a club
  called Razzmatazz in Rockingham, WA, with some of the ladies I met back in the Texan
  Rebel days.<br><br>Between 2002 to 2009, I starting competing in the WA Stomp competition.
